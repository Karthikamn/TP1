Q. Imagine you are tasked with setting up an EKS cluster for a new application. How would you approach this task, and what steps would you take?

Answer:

•	Start by creating an Amazon EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool like Terraform.
•	Ensure that the necessary IAM roles and policies are created to allow EKS to manage Kubernetes resources on your behalf.
•	Configure networking by creating a VPC with public and private subnets, route tables, and security groups.
•	Launch worker nodes (EC2 instances) and connect them to the EKS cluster using the appropriate IAM instance profile.
•	Install kubectl to interact with the cluster and configure the kubeconfig file to authenticate with the EKS cluster.
•	Deploy the Kubernetes add-ons like CoreDNS, kube-proxy, and Cluster Autoscaler to optimize cluster performance.


Q. How would you deploy a multi-tier application with a web frontend, a backend service, and a database in EKS?

Web Frontend: Create a Deployment and Service resource for the frontend. Use a LoadBalancer service type to expose it to external traffic.

Backend Service: Create a Deployment for the backend and expose it within the cluster using a ClusterIP service type.

Database: Use StatefulSets for database pods to maintain stable network identities and persistent storage. 
Configure PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for data storage.

Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data like database credentials.

Implement NetworkPolicies to ensure secure communication between frontend, backend, and database.

Q. Your application experiences a spike in traffic. How would you handle scaling in an EKS cluster?

Answer:

•	Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Configure HPA to automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU or memory usage.
•	Cluster Autoscaler: Ensure Cluster Autoscaler is deployed in the cluster to add or remove worker nodes based on the resource demands.
•	Use the AWS Auto Scaling Groups feature to manage EC2 instances effectively.
•	Monitor application performance using CloudWatch and Prometheus to ensure scaling policies are effective.


Q. What steps would you take to secure an EKS cluster in production? (explore all the points)

Answer:

Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for service accounts to control access to AWS resources.
Enable Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce least privilege access within the cluster.
Restrict API server access using security groups and CIDR blocks.
Use Secrets to store sensitive data and integrate with AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for enhanced security.
Regularly patch Kubernetes and worker node operating systems to fix vulnerabilities.
Enable AWS GuardDuty to detect threats in the EKS environment.

Q. How would you upgrade an EKS cluster to a newer Kubernetes version?

Answer:

Begin by reviewing the EKS release notes to understand the changes and compatibility requirements.
Upgrade the control plane to the desired Kubernetes version via the AWS Management Console or CLI.
Verify the upgrade by ensuring that workloads continue to function as expected.
Upgrade the kube-proxy, CoreDNS, and other Kubernetes add-ons to match the new Kubernetes version.
Update the worker nodes by launching new nodes with the updated AMI and gradually replacing the old ones.

Q. How would you set up monitoring and logging for an EKS cluster?

Answer:

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes metrics monitoring.
Use Fluentd or Fluent Bit to ship logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
Set up CloudWatch Container Insights to monitor EKS resources like nodes, pods, and containers.
Implement alerts for critical metrics such as CPU/memory usage, pod restarts, and API server errors.

Q. Your company is migrating to a microservices architecture. The application will be split into multiple services that need to communicate with each other. Which AWS service would you choose, and why?

Answer: Amazon ECS is the best choice for running microservices, as it provides better control over networking and container orchestration.
ECS allows you to define task definitions, configure service discovery, and use advanced networking features like VPC, ALBs, and service meshes. 
This flexibility makes ECS more suitable for managing complex microservices environments.


Q. Describe how you would deploy an application using AWS ECS.

Question Overview: Demonstrating a practical application of ECS deployment is key to understanding its operational use. Answer: Deploying an application on AWS ECS involves several steps:

Create a Task Definition: Define your application with one or more containers, specifying the Docker image, CPU, memory, ports, and environment variables.
Set Up a Cluster: Create an ECS cluster which will host your application. You can choose between EC2 and Fargate launch types.
Configure a Service: Create a service within your cluster, specifying the task definition to use, the desired number of tasks, and (if needed) the load balancer to distribute traffic to your tasks.
Deploy: Launch your service. ECS schedules and runs your tasks according to the configuration. For updates, you can create a new version of your task definition and update the service to use the new version, enabling rolling updates.
Monitor: Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance and logs of your containers and cluster, adjusting resources as needed.

Q. Your company is looking to run a containerized application on AWS with the goal of minimizing costs. What would you recommend: ECS on EC2 or ECS on Fargate?

Answer: If cost optimization is the priority, ECS on EC2 is a better option because it allows you to use Reserved Instances or Spot Instances, which can significantly reduce costs. 

ECS on Fargate is serverless and simplifies management but may be more expensive for long-running applications due to its pay-per-use pricing model.

Q. How would you ensure high availability and disaster recovery for an application deployed using ECS?

Answer:

Use multiple ECS clusters across different AWS regions for disaster recovery.
Configure ECS services with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to ensure high availability.
Use ECS task placement strategies to distribute tasks across multiple Availability Zones.
Implement automated backups for data and configuration using AWS Backup or S3.


Q. You notice that the ECS cluster’s CPU utilization is consistently high during peak hours. How would you address this issue?

View the Amazon ECS service event logs

View the CPU utilization for the container instance (EC2)

Choose the Monitoring tab, and then check the CPU utilization (%) card for the container instance CPU usage metrics.

View the cpU utilization for the Amazon ECS service
Use the Amazon ECS console to check the service metrics and the average CPU and maximum CPU for Amazon ECS.

Check your load balancer request metrics

Network ELB check ActiveFlowCount and NewFlowCount metrics.

for Application Load Balancer, then check the ActiveConnectionCount metric.


Q. A new application requires specialized hardware configurations that are not available in the existing ECS cluster. How would you handle this situation?

Task Placement Strategies:
- Define task placement constraints and strategies to control where tasks are placed within your cluster.
- Use task placement constraints to specify instance attributes or custom attributes for task placement, ensuring optimal resource utilization and performance.

Q. You need to ensure that critical tasks are always running in the ECS cluster, even in the event of instance failures. How would you achieve high availability for these tasks?



Q. You have a batch processing job that needs to run at a specific time each day. How would you schedule this task in ECS?

- ECS supports task scheduling using Amazon ECS Task Scheduler or third-party schedulers like Kubernetes or Nomad.
- Schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals, or in response to events or triggers using AWS Lambda or Amazon EventBridge.


Q. Your team is deploying a new version of a microservice to the ECS cluster. How would you perform a rolling update to minimize downtime?

Configure deployment strategies such as rolling updates or blue/green deployments to minimize downtime and ensure high availability.

Q. You need to implement service discovery for a set of microservices running in the ECS cluster. How would you approach this task?

Use AWS Cloud Map for service discovery, allowing tasks within your ECS cluster to discover and communicate with each other using DNS.
Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) or Application Load Balancers (ALB) to distribute traffic across tasks within your ECS service.
